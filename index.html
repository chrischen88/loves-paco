                <h2>Who is Paco?</h2>
                <p>
                    Paco is a six year-old mixed doggie from Austin, Texas. He has a very chilled-out
                    temperament, but he is still playful when he wants to be! The homeboy loves to 
                    lounge around, play with other animals (if the other animal allows it), and while 
                    he may not show it, he loves any attention he can get üê∂

                <h2>What to Expect with Paco</h2>
                <p>
                    For the most part, Paco is a fairly hands-off kinda guy, fairly independent throughout his day, 
                    but he will let you know when he wants/needs something. He'll typically sit in plain view of you as if he is waiting on you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He is not the type to run off, but he does like to see who's at the door.
                    He will not attack or pounce onto the home visitor. He's just a curious fella, if you will!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Walks with him are very relaxing, but he can be a little tricky sometimes, as he really 
                    enjoys meeting new dogs. He responds fairly well to correction tugs (quick, light pulls on the leash)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fair warning!! Dude is a major beggar, he will definitely sit next to you and plead for whatever you have.
                    Fight against his cuteness!!

                <h2>Paco's Daily Needs</h2>
                <p>Typically, Paco's day will look like this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>3-4 walks a day</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>At least one of them lasting 20-30 minutes</li>
                            <li>Pooping 1-2 times a day</li>
                            <li>Typically around 9AM, 4PM, and 11PM</li>
                            <li>I've been told that he likes to take advantage of his substitute caretakers 
                                and refuse to move if he doesn't get his way during walks. 
                                Don't be afraid to show the little rascal who's boss and give 
                                correction to his behavior. He means well, just likes to test his lucküò°</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>2 meals a day</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Half a cup of kibble (found in the food container)</li>
                            <li>2 pumps of salmon oil</li>
                            <li>Typically around 11AM and 6/7PM</li>
                            <li>Please keep his water bowl filled throughout the day</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Some treats in between!</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>He loves the Milk Bone Marosnacks that I have!</li>
                            <li>Please give treats in moderation. If you feel you might have
                                given him too many treats, dial back on his kibble for the next meal.</li>
                            <li>While Paco can eat most human foods with no BIG issue, I kindly request that 
                                you do not give him human foods. He has a more-sensitive-than-average stomach.
                                If you feel he really deserves it, 
                                please limit the amount he gets to a finger-size, once a week!
                            </li>
                            <li><b>As a reminder,</b> dogs <i>esp. Paco</i> <u>CANNOT</u> eat the following foods:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Garlic</li>
                                    <li>Onions</li>
                                    <li>Chives</li>
                                    <li>Avocados</li>
                                    <li>Grapes</li>
                                    <li>Chocolate</li>
